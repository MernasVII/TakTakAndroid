# TakTakAndroid
TakTak app is based on digitalizing the whole process using a mobile application; from looking for service providers registered on the app, booking an appointment according to the tradespersonâ€™s pre-set schedule by choosing a specific date and time, to rating and paying the rendered service.
The app also allows the customer to request a service and receive bids from different service providers. He can then choose the most convenient offer.
